# Digital Composting & Hospicing Journey: Exploring Digital Afterlives

This project is an interactive web application that serves as a demo for a presentation and workshop on the "Only Loss" paper. It guides users through a digital composting and hospicing journey for their digital artifacts, illustrating key concepts from the paper and providing a foundation for discussion.

## Features

- Upload and process digital artifacts (memories), distinguishing between IDM and ADM
- Create memory seeds and compost digital memories, challenging digital essentialism
- Set up hospice parameters for composted digital artifacts, exploring digital legacy management
- Simulate the passage of time and its effect on composted memories, reflecting on digital dasein
- Prompt reflection on key concepts from the "Only Loss" paper throughout the journey

## Process

1. Upload a digital artifact (IDM or ADM)
2. Create a memory seed
3. Compost the digital memory
4. Set hospice parameters for the composted artifact
5. Simulate the passage of time and reflect on the process

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `src/index.html` in a web browser

## Using the Demo

This demo is designed to be used as part of a presentation or workshop. As participants interact with the application:

1. Introduce key concepts from the "Only Loss" paper at each step
2. Encourage reflection on how the interactive elements relate to the paper's ideas
3. Use the final reflection questions as starting points for group discussion
